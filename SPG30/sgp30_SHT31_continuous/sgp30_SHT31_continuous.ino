// this version is to display VOC and CO2 continuously and average over 16 data
// we skip 0 and 400. We use the sensor SHT31 from adafruit. 
// 7/3/20  I removed the temperature sensor that was damaged. we supposed temp is 36 and hum 85 because the sensor will be placed inside the mask. 
//6/15/20 I modified the code again so it displays temp,humidity,VOC,CO2 every 60s about. And the VOC and CO2 are now averages. I average 12 data.
// we wait 5s before reading any daya (temp, humidity, VOC , CO2). 12 x 5=60s. so we average 12 data evrey 5s and then display. 
// Also I don't record anymore in the SD card. So I dont open files anymore in the SD card. 
// Also since the SPG30 needs the temp and humidity for its measurements I use the temp and humidity conituously for the SPG30. 
// Before we measured humidity and temperature only once before reading the VOC and CO2. (since we didn't expect a change over the time we were measuring. 
// 
// 6/14/20  I modified the code so it continuously displays counter,temperature,humidity,VOC, CO2. we are not using the SD card any more
// so the code has be modified so we read now the temperature and the humidity not only before the loop() but also inside the loop
// so it is continously reading temperature and humidity. 
// 4/27/20 I have added succesively a temperature/humidity sensor. 
// the SHT31 from adaffruit. https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht31-d-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-breakout/wiring-and-test
// It works well. However, both sensors use the I2C bus. So we read first teh temperature and the humidity and then we close the communication
// If the sensor SHT31 does not work then we take a temp by default and humidity = 50%

// 4/19/10 warning / if not used for a long time you need to run it outside and get a new base line.
// tempeature sensor does not work. I supposed temperature of 15C to be modified
// 5/2/19 humidity is 50%
// number_data is the nubmer of data to collect. 
// I removed the temperature sensor because it competes with the sensor for current. 
// If the sensor is not used for a few days you need to check the baselines number.
// for that run the test code by adafruit https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sgp30-gas-tvoc-eco2-mox-sensor/arduino-code
// spg30_adafruit.ino   the 4/19 I found ****Baseline values: eCO2: 0x96C1 & TVOC: 0x9047
// finally got the kit C02 (sgp30 from adafruit) and the temperature to work at the same time and for to record the data in the SD card.
// had to make some change in the code.
// first make sure there is a connection between the ICPS headers (for SPI) between arduino and the shield. Otherwise, they say to flip the shield and make a path for SPI.
// arduino uno has SPI (for SD card)  at 10 (slave select) 11, 12 , 13  (clck).   I2C (for clock and sensor spg30) uses A4 and A5 for arduino R3
// temperature sensor TMT36 uses A0
// Then I read  he temperature once in setup() . So I don't start the SD card, the clock, the C02 until temperature is read.
// temperature is read for the C02 sensor. I set humidity to 50%.
//
// TVOC 969 ppb eCO2 1340 ppm example of reading

// There is now an LED that turns on when the loop starts and turn off when we stop recording (90 data).
// I un commented lines to include temperature and humidity to improve the Co2 sensor as recommended by adafruit.

// the sensor for C02  SGP30  and organic matter comes from:
