/*
 *  * ME2-O2-Ð¤20 electrochemical sensor
 * The module (that includes a sensor)  was developped by: 
 * https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas_Sensor-O2/
 * 
 * The connections with the module are very easy. One for Vin (5V), one for Gnd, one for A0 of arduino 
 * The code is provided by Grove (above) and turn the voltage measured  to concentration of O2 in %. 
 * We expect a concentration of 20.9% outside. You can tune the calibration by changing the int calibration = 2;
 * We can try 1.9 fro example if the concentration is too small. 
 * 
 * First we run the code for 5 minutes to heat up and stabilize. During that time the concentration will decrease toa stable value.
 * Then we display the concentration every 30s continuously. 
 * In both phases, the data are averaged over 32 measurements. 
 *

 * 
 * we bought the module from: 
 * https://www.amazon.com/Air-Quality-Sensors-Grove-Sensor/dp/B01AUVL8HW
 * 
 * Please power the Gas Sensor(O2) more than 48 hrs before you get data from it.
 * THe sensor needs  10 minutes to heat
