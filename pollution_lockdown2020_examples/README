During the lockdown Spring 2020 in NYC, we used our Arduino based sensors to record the pollution. We kept recording it when the lockdown was over. But NYC was not fully open.

You can see the trend up for the pollution. The sensors were reliable and with a good resolution (better than breezometer.com).

Surveying was done on Broadway. Next to Van Cortland Parc/
